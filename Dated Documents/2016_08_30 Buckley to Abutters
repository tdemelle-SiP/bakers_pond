Hi everyone,

I thought I would forward the decision from the DEP regarding the 42 Mill Street property.  Delapa had hired a consultant and asked the DEP to refute the town's assessment of the wetlands boundaries.  It sounds like the DEP is unwilling to rule any differently and confirms the area contains a perennial stream, which hopefully carries more stringent building requirements.

Bottom line--good news for us in protecting this wetland area.

Thanks for caring, and please keep us informed if you hear anything else.

Greg
