Greg,

Just wanted to keep you updated.  The applicant has appealed DEP's decision.  I have forwarded this information to the Town's attorney.

Hi Karon,

So Delapa is appealing DEP's decision.  If they're appealing, who hears that appeal and what role does the Town of Westwood have?

Thanks.

Hi Greg,

DEP's Office of Appeals & Dispute Resolution will hear it.  The Town and DEP will both defend the decision.  Town Counsel and I will attend.

Hello everyone, it looks like Delapa is still fighting this.  Hearing set for Jan 24 2017.  Karon will let us know if neighbors should attend.

I just looked at the Superseding Order and don't see how it could be improved from your POV since DEP affirmed all the town's determinations.  DEP reversals are rare, but because the payoff is significant the developer may proceed anyway.
