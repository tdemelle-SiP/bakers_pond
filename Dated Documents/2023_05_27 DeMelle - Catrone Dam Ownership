Hi Karon!

Happy Summer!  I just received the certified mail notification regarding the intent to repair the Baker's Pond dam.  Is there more detail on what repairing it means?  With the beaver activity recently, the pond is as full as I've ever seen it.

It also seems a good time to follow up on my old question about where the dam falls relative to plot lines.  Photos and GPS points attached again.

Thanks for any thoughts or details you can provide.  I hope all's well!
