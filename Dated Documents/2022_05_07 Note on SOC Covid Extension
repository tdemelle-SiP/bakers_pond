# Status of DEP #338-0706 permit extension investigation

**Covid extension, Chapter 53, not applicable.** This SOC was issued on May 6, 2022, which is AFTER the COVID-19 state of emergency ended (June 15, 2021)
Therefore, Chapter 53's automatic tolling provisions which took effect on 2020_04_03, do NOT apply to this specific order
The order follows standard validity rules: 3 years from issuance (expires May 6, 2025) unless extended.

**No apparent extension filed for the May 6, 2025 expiration.** Comprehensive searches found no evidence of Form 7 extension applications, new Notice of Intent filings, or Conservation Commission discussions about DEP File #338-0706 at 42 Mill Street, Westwood during the critical March-April 2025 timeframe. The Superseding Order of Conditions appears to have expired without renewal.

For wetlands permits in Massachusetts, failure to file extensions before expiration typically means any future work requires a new Notice of Intent application, potentially triggering a full review process. The property owner would need to restart the permitting process if they intend to proceed with the originally approved work.
