Hi Karon,

I attended a conservation committee meeting recently where the Bakers Pond dam at the site was mentioned as being in disrepair and the property owners' responsibility to maintain.

Looking at the GIS map (image attached), the stream flowing out from the pond is drawn through the neighboring plot suggesting the dam is on that property, but it always seemed to me as if the dam and stream were actually closer to our property.  I took the attached photos showing the state of the dam and marked the location of the shots using GPS.  It looks like the dam is pretty much right on the property line.

Questions
1. Which parcel owns the dam?
2. What responsibilities or permitting apply if the owner wants to repair it?

Thanks for your help, Karon.

Todd,

I remember your beetle project well and I'm glad it was a success.  I'm cc'ing the Town's attorney; this question is probably better addressed by him.  Let me know if there is anything I can do after hearing from him.

Hope all is well!

Karon
