	-situation analysis
		-themes/patterns
		-pressure points
		-missed insights and issues?
		-is the pattern of critical decisions being made outside public view something that arises to a specific point of issue?
		The overall pattern of a denied application morphing into an approved delineation through closed-door negotiations.
		4. The 2016 Settlement Execution
- Public body negotiating wetlands boundaries in closed session  
- Settlement negotiated in Executive Session (Nov 9)
- No public input on environmental compromise
- Settlement terms only revealed after signing
The substantive outcome
- Commission denied the ANRAD completely
- DEP upheld that denial
- Yet settlement gives Delapa an ORAD anyway (under bylaw only)      
- They got through settlement what they couldn't win on merits
		-is this a point worth adding to the pattern of inaccuracy and unprofessionalism?
		3. Wrong Applicant Name (June-October 2020)
- Initial NOI lists "Salvatore Vinci" not Delapa Properties
- Only corrected after multiple hearings
- Creates procedural questions about proper notice

	-what's the significance of:
	The waiver of appeal rights
- Both sides gave up further administrative review
- Unusual to lock in a compromise on resource delineation
- No ability to revisit if conditions change
	-Flesh out / Update Cribsheet
		-DEP filing # key
		-contact lists

		How can this be added to the case:
		7. Limiting exposure to dam repair cost to $25k and then using that as a pretext for changing their aim to destroying the dam entirely.

		What about repetitive continuances? What does that say and what impact does that have on the publics ability to contest or oppose the plans.

Has the order been recorded in the registry of deeds?  No work shall be undertaken until the Order has become final and then has been recorded in the Registry of Deeds or the Land Court for the district in which the land is located, within the chain of title of the affected property.

Goddard's response booklet states house work will be done while dam repair is being done


	What Delapa Wanted (2014-2015):

  An ANRAD = "This is where we think the wetlands are"
  If approved → ORAD = "Official map of wetland boundaries, locked in for 3 years"

  What Actually Happened:

  Round 1: Local Level
  - Delapa: "Here's where we think the wetlands are" (minimal)
  - Conservation Commission: "No, the wetlands are much bigger than that"
  - DENIED (October 2015)

  Round 2: State Appeal
  - Delapa: "DEP, please overrule the local commission"
  - DEP: "We reviewed it. The Commission was right"
  - DENIED (August 2016)

  Round 3: The Lawsuit Threat
  - Delapa: "We'll sue everyone"
  - Behind closed doors: "What if we make a deal?"
  - Settlement: "OK, you can have your ORAD, but only under local rules, not state"
  - APPROVED through settlement (November 2016)

  The Key Point:

  They lost on the science (wetlands really were bigger) but won through legal pressure. The Town gave them officially-approved wetland boundaries to avoid a lawsuit, even though two separate reviews said those boundaries were wrong.

  It's like losing a game fair and square, then getting the trophy anyway because you threatened to sue the league.

  - What's the Commission's strategy if Delapa appeals another denial to DEP?

  - What would need to change for the Commission to feel empowered to take a stronger stance?
- Are there other Town departments (DPW, Select Board) that could assert interests here?

Goddard exploitation and manipulation of The pattern -- DEP is institutionally constrained to evaluate whether narrow regulatory standards are met, while the Commission takes a more holistic view of site constraints.  The key tension: DEP evaluates "does this plan meet minimum standards?" while the Commission asks "should development happen here at all?"

------ Pre 2014 Development Applications? ------
Date: Pre-2014
