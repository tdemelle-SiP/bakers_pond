Hi everyone,

A few of us attended the Conservation Commission meeting the other night.  There wasn't a lot of new information, although I felt the Commission is adamant about that land not being developed and will fight the current efforts to do so.

They recommended we come up with a timeline of all the times a development plan has been brought and rejected, then draft a letter with resident signatures to help them defend their position.

Could those of you who have been in the neighborhood longer than me try to remember all the times this occurred?  I'm happy to draft the letter once we have the facts.

Thanks again for your help.

Greg
