## Understanding the Process

If you're new to Massachusetts wetlands regulations, here's a simplified overview:

1. **Property owners** must get permits before building near wetlands
2. **Local Conservation Commissions** review applications first
3. **State DEP** can be asked to review local decisions
4. **Public hearings** allow neighbors and experts to provide input
5. **Appeals** can go through administrative and court proceedings

The 42 Mill Street case has gone through all these steps multiple times since 2014.
