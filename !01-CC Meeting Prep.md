July 23, 2025 - DEP #338-0756 Dam Restoration Project
[Speak clearly and calmly, with confidence]

Good evening, Commissioners. My name is Todd DeMelle, and I live at 1355 High Street, directly abutting Bakers Pond. I'm here to raise critical concerns about the dam restoration project before you tonight.

1. The Foundation of This Project Has Expired
The applicant's construction sequence, submitted in September 2023, states that Step 1 is: "Construction of access into the site per Superseding Order of Conditions DEP File #338-0706."

Addordint to the Superseding Order, it expired on May 6, 2025 - over two months ago. The applicant no longer has legal authorization to build the access infrastructure that their entire dam project depends upon.
[Pause for emphasis]
The Commission cannot approve a project based on an expired permit. The applicant must either:
Amend this NOI to include the wetland crossing, or Submit a new NOI for the crossing
Until they have valid authorization, any work in the wetlands would violate state regulations.

1. Page 9 of the SOC (at the bottom) states: "This Order is valid for three years from the date of issuance"
2. Page 9 of the SOC shows: "Date: 5-6-22" (May 6, 2022)

2. Dam Ownership Remains Contested
As acknowledged in your July 26, 2023 minutes, ownership of this dam is disputed. I maintain that the dam sits on my property, not the applicant's. It would be premature to approve repairs to a structure when ownership hasn't been legally established.

3. Pattern of Misrepresentation
This project represents the latest in a decade-long pattern of attempts to develop this property:

2015-2016: ANRAD denied, appealed to DEP
2020-2021: Single-family home denied by this Commission
2022: State overruled your denial with a Superseding Order
2023: Now seeking dam "restoration" that includes a permanent 10-foot access road
[Slight pause]
This isn't about dam safety - it's about building development infrastructure under the guise of environmental restoration.

4. Incomplete Peer Review
was the BETA group review of this project ever made public?  Ask BETA’s final peer‑review memo to be produced and posted before any new hearing opens. Demand it as part of the public record under G.L. c. 66 §10 Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 66, section 10 (public‑records law);

5. Outstanding Public Records Request
I filed a public records request on June 29, 2023 - over two years ago - for documents related to this property. The Town has never responded, violating state law. This lack of transparency undermines the integrity of this process.

In Closing
[Speak with conviction but remain respectful]

Commissioners, I urge you to:

Reject this application based on the expired permit foundation
Require the applicant to properly permit their wetland crossing
Wait for BETA to complete their review
Resolve the ownership dispute before approving any work
This property has a long history of regulatory violations and misrepresentations. Please don't allow another attempt to circumvent your authority through misleading applications.

Thank you for your time and careful consideration.

If Asked Follow-Up Questions:
Q: "How do you know the SOC expired?"
A: The Superseding Order was issued May 6, 2022, valid for three years. It expired May 6, 2025. Today is July 23, 2025.

Q: "What's your evidence of ownership?"
A: I have property surveys and historical documents showing the dam's location. I've previously provided this information to the Commission.

Q: "Why do you think this is about development?"
A: The 10-foot permanent access road, the staging area, and the infrastructure exactly match what was proposed for the denied residential development. The dam is non-functional rubble - this is about access, not restoration.

Q: "What about dam safety?"
A: If safety were the real concern, why keep the dam height at exactly 4.6 feet - just under the 6-foot threshold for state dam safety regulations? This is designed to avoid oversight, not ensure safety.

Key Documents to Bring:
Copy of the expired SOC showing May 6, 2022 date
September 2023 peer review response showing reliance on expired permit
Your original March 2016 email about dam ownership
Screenshot of outstanding FOIA request

The dam‑repair filing (NOI #338‑0756) still quotes:

Step 1
“Construction of access … per Superseding Order of Conditions (DEP #338‑0706) … This work is already permitted”.

That statement was true on 8 Sep 2023 (the date of this booklet), because the SOC for 0706 was then in force; it did not expire until 26 May 2025. If the applicant never filed a Form 7 extension, the 0706 permit has now lapsed, so the access road is no longer authorized.

“Any extension … shall be made on Form 7. The request must reach the issuing authority at least 30 days prior to expiration.” 310 CMR 10.05 (8)(a)‑(d) Title 310 of the Code of Massachusetts Regulations, section 10.05, subsection (8), paragraphs (a) through (d).

Implications

1. The construction sequence in NOI #338‑0756 is outdated.
2. Before any work proceeds the applicant must:
 • amend NOI #338‑0756 to include the wetland crossing, or
 • submit a new NOI solely for the crossing.
3. Until a fresh Order (or an extension issued before expiry) is in hand, any attempt to clear or fill the BVW would violate 310 CMR 10.05(6).   Title 310 of the Code of Massachusetts Regulations, section 10.05, subsection (6)

Next step: Ask the Commission to require an amended plan eliminating references to DEP #338‑0706 and re‑permitting the crossing under an active Order of Conditions.

## Delapa's Strategy

The dam restoration project appears to be a strategic move to advance the development agenda through several mechanisms:

### Key Strategic Benefits:

1. Access Road Infrastructure
The NOI explicitly includes "Dam repair and access road" - this is the smoking gun. Building a road for "dam maintenance" creates permanent infrastructure that could later serve residential development.

2. Establishing Control 
By claiming responsibility for dam maintenance, Delapa:
- Asserts ownership over a contested boundary feature
- Justifies ongoing site access
- Creates precedent for property control

3. Regulatory Pathway
After multiple failed attempts at direct development:
- Pre-2015: Multiple rejections
- 2016: DEP upheld wetland restrictions
- 2021: Limited approval for single-family home     

The dam project represents a new approach - using environmental restoration as justification for infrastructure development.

4. Physical Site Changes
Dam work could:
- Alter water flow patterns
- Potentially affect wetland boundaries over time
- Create conditions for future regulatory reassessment

5. Less Opposition
"Dam maintenance" faces less community resistance than "residential development" even though both require similar infrastructure.        

### The Pattern:
1. Failed direct attempts →
2. Switch to "environmental" project →
3. Build access infrastructure →
4. Use infrastructure for future development        

This appears to be a classic case of achieving development goals incrementally through alternative regulatory pathways, using environmental restoration as cover for infrastructure development that primarily benefits future construction plans.

### 2021-2022: The Suit

# Delapa Realty Tr. (Joanne Delapa, Tr.) v. Westwood Conservation Commission  
**Norfolk Superior Court No. 2282CV00038** — *Blow‑by‑blow drawn only from user‑supplied OCR PDFs*

| Date | Procedural / factual step (verbatim cite ⇢) | Legal meaning | Environmental‑integrity angle | Strategic / power influence |
|------|---------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **18 Oct 2021** | *“Applicant hereby withdraws its local‑by‑law Notice of Intent…”* (p. 8 ¶38) | Tries to remove local by‑law jurisdiction before any vote. | Signals preference for state‑level (WPA) review only. | Procedural gambit: avoid stricter town standards & potential litigation cost. |
| **10 Nov 2021** | *“Commission voted 7‑0 to deny under WPA **and** By‑law.”* (p. 8 ¶39) | Board refuses withdrawal & issues denial anyway. | Presents itself as protecting 26 638 sf of resources incl. perennial stream. | Commission flexes authority—provokes higher‑forum contest. |
| **18 Nov 2021** | Written **Order of Conditions (Denial)** issued; cites 26 638 sf total impact, perennial stream, 10 ft NDZ. (Order attach. pp. 2‑3) | Final agency action ripe for appeal. | Frames project as major BVW / riverfront threat. | Creates appealable record; sets stage for certiorari. |
| **12 Jan 2022** | **Petition for Certiorari & Declaratory Relief** filed (31 pp). Counts: 1 (certiorari), 2 (declaratory—by‑law ≠ stricter), 3 (declaratory—Commission lacked withdrawal discretion). (p. 11 ¶¶51‑56) | Opens Superior Ct. oversight; seeks reversal & order to approve. | Attacks procedure, not science; alleges Commission ignored binding 2016 **FORAD**. | High leverage: small filing fee vs. big risk to town.  |
| **31 Mar 2022** | Affidavit & Acceptance of Service; Town counsel Ahearn appears (docket). | Court jurisdiction perfected. | Parties now bound to schedules. | Cost meter starts for both sides. |
| **20 Apr 2022** | **Answer** filed (docket). | Joins issue; preserves defenses incl. local by‑law authority. | Town still stands on environmental findings. | Minimal spend; litigation could escalate. |
| **14 Aug 2022** | Judge’s **Status‑review order**: file update by 9 Sep or case dismissed. | Court pushes progress per Mass. R. Civ. P. 78. | No environmental content. | Pressure both sides—settle or brief. |
| **08 Sep 2022** | Joint status: *“agreement in principle; anticipate Commission public vote; need 60 days.”* (docket) | Settlement path announced; clock reset. | Deal‑making goes private. | Saves discovery / expert costs. |
| **09 Sep 2022** | Court continues to 9 Nov with dismissal warning. | Keeps pressure. | — | Cheap time extension; encourages deal finalisation. |
| **26 Oct 2022** | **Settlement Agreement/MOU** signed (not on docket but provided earlier). Key terms: Commission adopts MassDEP **SOC #338‑0706** as its WPA decision; Delapa files new NOI for dam repair (cost cap $25 000). | Resolves lawsuit contingently. | Town concedes WPA issue; retains by‑law say on dam work. | Compromise: avoids trial expense; house path clears, dam separated. |
| **20 Dec 2022** | Joint report: *“Settlement nearly complete; need 30 days.”* (docket) | Paperwork phase. | — | Delay cheaper than motion briefs. |
| **27 Mar 2023** | Second status‑review order—respond by 28 Apr. | Judge impatient. | — | Forces final filings. |
| **24 Apr 2023** | Plaintiff letter: *“Case settled; need 60 days for stipulation.”* — Court enters **Dismissal Nisi** expiring 26 Jun. | Automatic dismissal unless stip filed. | — | Hard deadline; ensures compliance with MOU conditions (e.g., filing dam NOI). |
| **22 Jun 2023** | **Joint Stipulation of Dismissal with prejudice; each side bears own fees.** (docket) | Case permanently closed; no cost‑shifting. | Integrity now dependent on permitting follow‑through. | Legal spend ends; parties avoid unpredictable judgment. |
| **23 Jun 2023** | Docket disposition: *“Disposed by Agreement / Settled.”* | Litigation leverage ends. | Environmental enforcement shifts back to Commission & DEP. | Settlement efficiency prevails over courtroom adjudication. |

---

## Influence balance (derived from filings)

| Influence | Evidence & effect | Who prevailed |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| **Procedural law** | Complaint centers on withdrawal right, FORAD supremacy, by‑law equivalence. Judge’s status orders push settlement. | **Delapa** gained leverage; Commission ceded WPA fight. |
| **Environmental integrity** | Commission’s denial cites large resource impacts; plaintiff never refutes numbers—argues process. Settlement splits dam vs. house, leaving real wetland alteration to later NOI. | **Mixed:** Town retains by‑law review for dam; house proceeds under SOC. |
| **Money & time** | No motions, discovery, or trial. Multiple continuances, quick dismissal. Each side pays own fees. | **Both saved costs**, but Delapa secures project path; town avoids fee liability. |
| **State authority vs. local autonomy** | DEP FORAD (2016) & SOC (2022) underpin plaintiff’s case; settlement forces Commission to adopt SOC. | **State standards trump local** for house/crossing; local retains dam oversight (for now). |

**Overall:** Legal‐procedural leverage and cost‑containment prevailed. The Commission’s environmental concerns were sidelined in court and partially parked in a future NOI, reflecting a strategy where **process wins over substance** when litigation risk and expense loom.


---

## Condensed Essence of the Litigation (added for quick reference)

**Core dispute** – Delapa’s single‑family‑home NOI was denied by the Commission under both the Wetlands Protection Act (WPA) and Westwood’s wetlands by‑law. She claims the Commission ignored a 2016 DEP Final ORAD, refused her withdrawal request, and applied no standards beyond WPA.

**Legal strategy** – The 31‑page complaint focuses on procedural error: certiorari to overturn the denial and declaratory counts to nullify the by‑law’s reach. This moved leverage from local regulators to Superior Court with modest filing costs.

**Commission stance** – The written denial cites 26 638 sf of wetland impacts, designates the on‑site stream perennial, and flags driveway/buffer violations—an integrity position grounded in broader wetland boundaries.

**Settlement mechanics** – Faced with repeated status‑review warnings (Aug 2022–Mar 2023) and rising litigation costs, the parties struck a deal on 26 Oct 2022: Commission adopts DEP Superseding OOC #338‑0706 (house & crossing approved); Delapa files a new NOI for dam work capped at $25 000.

**Outcome** – Joint dismissal with prejudice on 22 Jun 2023; each side bears its own fees. Procedural leverage and cost containment prevail: Delapa secures access & house, Commission retains dam oversight under its by‑law.

**Influence balance**
- *Process & state authority* overrode local environmental rigor.
- *Money/time efficiency* drove settlement pre‑motion.
- *Environmental integrity questions* (large impacts, perennial‑stream dispute) remain untested until dam‑repair NOI review.

### Key Issues from 2023 Conservation Commission Meetings:
1. **Dam Ownership Dispute** (July 26, 2023): Commission acknowledged ownership is contested
2. **Expired Permit Foundation**: Construction sequence relies on SOC (DEP #338-0706) that **EXPIRED May 6, 2025**
3. **Extended BETA Peer Review**: 6+ months of continuances for engineering review
4. **Community Opposition**: Multiple abutters raised concerns about water levels, beaver removal, and property impacts
5. **Access Infrastructure**: Plan includes 10-foot wide permanent access road through wetlands

### Key DEP File Numbers:
- **DEP #338-0594**: Initial development attempt (2015) - Order of Conditions and Superseding Order
- **DEP #338-0706**: Single-family home development (2020-2021) - **DENIED November 2021 by ConCom; Superseding Order issued May 2022; SOC EXPIRED May 6, 2025**
- **DEP #338-0756**: Dam restoration project (2023-present)
- **Docket WET-2016-022**: Appeal of DEP Superseding Order

## Notes from the Superseding Order of Conditions 2022_05_06

2016_12_19
On December 19, 2016, MassDEP issued a Final Order of Resource Area Delineation (FORAD), DEP File #338-0594, for the project site. The FORAD received an Extension Permit on December 24, 2019, with a new expiration date of December 19, 2022.

2021_11_18
On November 18, 2021, the WCC issued an Order of Conditions (OOC) denying the project based on its opinion that the proposed project could not be conditioned to meet the performance standards set forth in the Regulations of the local Bylaw.
