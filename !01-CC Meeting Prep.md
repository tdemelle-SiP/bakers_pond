# 42 Mill St - WCC Application

### CURRENT STATUS
##### Notice of Intent - DEP #338-0756 - Delapa Dam maintenance

### MAIN ISSUES

#### 1. The Foundation of This Project Has Expired
The applicant's construction sequence, submitted in September 2023, states that Step 1 is: "Construction of access into the site per Superseding Order of Conditions DEP File #338-0706."

##### the referenced superseding order states:

1. Page 9 of the SOC (at the bottom) states: "This Order is valid for three years from the date of issuance, unless otherwise specified as a special condition pursuant to General Conditions # 4 or # 6."
2. Page 9 of the SOC shows: "Date: 5-6-22" (May 6, 2022)

##### and...

The work authorized hereunder shall be completed within three years from the date of this Order unless either of the following apply:
a. the work is a maintenance dredging project as provided for in the Act

##### state law regulates extensions as follows...
"Pursuant to 310 CMR 10.05(8)(a)-(d), 'Any extension ... shall be made on Form 7. The request must reach the issuing authority at least 30 days prior to expiration.'"  

**SOC #338-0706 expiration verification** - Can you confirm the expiration date? (Timeline shows May 6, 2025 but SOC was issued May 6, 2022) Was a Form 7 extension filed for SOC #338-0706 before it expired?

##### Conclusion
Although the statement in the applicant's filing was true on 8 Sep 2023 (the date of the booklet), because the SOC for 0706 was then in force, if the applicant never filed a Form 7 extension, the 0706 permit has now lapsed.

The access road is no longer authorized and the applicant no longer has legal authorization to build the access infrastructure that their entire dam project depends upon.

Before any work proceeds the applicant must:
 • amend NOI #338‑0756 to include the wetland crossing, or
 • submit a new NOI solely for the crossing.

Until then, any attempt to clear or fill the BVW would violate 310 CMR 10.05(6).   Title 310 of the Code of Massachusetts Regulations, section 10.05, subsection (6)

(Title 310 of the Code of Massachusetts Regulations, section 10.05, subsection (8), paragraphs (a) through (d).)

#### 2. The scope of the work has changed from dam repair to dam removal

##### The SOC states:
Any change to the plans identified in Condition #13 above shall require the applicant to inquire of the Department in writing whether the change is significant enough to require the filing of a new Notice of Intent.

#### 3. Dam Ownership Remains Contested
As acknowledged in your July 26, 2023 minutes and reiterated again in the July 23, 2025 WCC meeting, ownership of this dam is disputed. I maintain that the dam sits on my property, not the applicant's. It would be premature to approve repairs to a structure when ownership hasn't been legally established.  The applicant has consistently included plot borders that deviate from the original deed borders, historical documents and property surveys in order to show that the damn and stream are on their plot when they are not.

  - Are there any town records referencing the dam, its construction, maintenance or repair or suggesting its ownership?
  - What's the Town's position on dam ownership given the
  settlement requires Delapa to repair it?
  - Has the Town Attorney provided guidance on liability if the dam fails?

---

#### 4. Lots happening outside public view:
- Are there any maps with the wetland borders or recognized geological features of Baker's Pond shown on them available to the public?

- The applicants maps are highly inaccurate
The area of the pond that is open water and has been open water for all but a few months total of the 21 years lived next to it is shown as BVW on the applicants map. One map even shows a proposed driveway to the new home directly through the open water of the pond.

##### Important procedural decision making is happening outside public view
- The October 26, 2022 settlement required Delapa to file a dam NOI - but the January 10, 2024 hearing closed without approval. What's the status now?
 - What were the specific reasons for requiring re-notification in January 2024?
- was the BETA group review of this project ever made public?  Ask BETA’s final peer‑review memo to be produced and posted before any new hearing opens. Demand it as part of the public record under G.L. c. 66 §10 Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 66, section 10 (public‑records law);

### Missing Key Documents
1. **Original ANRAD application materials (November 14, 2014, DEP #338-0594)** - What exactly did Delapa propose for wetland boundaries in the initial filing?
2. **July 8, 2020 Conservation Commission minutes** - The initial hearing for the single-family home proposal
3. **September 9, 2020 Conservation Commission minutes** - When peer review was ordered (we received July 22, 2020 minutes instead)
4. **October 14, 2020 Conservation Commission minutes** - Referenced in timeline but not in repository
5. **November 18, 2021 Written Order of Conditions (Denial)** - The formal denial document with specific findings
6. **November 2016 Settlement Agreement** - Between Delapa, Town, and DEP resolving the ANRAD appeal
7. **Pre-2014 development applications** - Don Foley mentioned "3 prior denials" at the October 28, 2015 meeting - what were these attempts?
8. **BETA peer review findings** - What specific issues did BETA identify with the dam project? Is their final report available?


### Other Questions
1. **Settlement terms** - Why did the 2016 settlement split the house approval from dam work? Was this a ConCom requirement?
2. **Beaver management** - What is the Town's position on beaver removal mentioned in the July 26, 2023 minutes?
3. **Stream classification** - Is Mill Brook still classified as perennial per the 2015 peer review?

#### 5. Related - Outstanding Public Records Request
I filed a public records request on June 29, 2023 - over two years ago - for documents related to this property. The Town has never responded, violating state law. This lack of transparency undermines the integrity of this process.

Open FOIA request from 2023
https://www.townforms.com/FOIADirect-WestwoodMACitizens/Private/External/Request/RequestorDashboard.aspx

Any records relevant to 41 Mill St or abutting properties relative to the proposal to develop 42 Mill St that had been on the conservation commission agenda for 6/28 and that was continued to 7/12.

Request Sent: 06/29/2023 12:06 AM
Request Received: 06/29/2023 08:30 AM
Response Due by: 07/14/2023
Response:[Request is still open]

A public‑records request must receive a written response within 10 business days (G.L. c.66 §10(a)) 
Massachusetts General Court
.
No response for two years violates the law and is grounds to challenge the town’s handling of the project record.

Action
	1. File an appeal with the Secretary of State’s Supervisor of Records (email: pre@sec.state.ma.us). Include your original request and proof of non‑response; the Supervisor can order production and impose fines 
	Massachusetts Sec. of the Commonwealth
	2. Send the same packet to MassDEP and note the missing records in any permitting comments; lack of transparency can weigh against the applicant’s submissions.

#### 6. Pattern of General Dubiousness

1. The Scale "Error" (October 2020)
- GEC peer review found plans showed 1"=30' but measurements were at 1"=40'
- This made ALL setbacks 25% shorter than depicted
- Hard to see this as accidental on professional engineering plans
2. No apparent acknowledgement of any open water in maps of the pond.
3. Wrong Applicant Name (June-October 2020)
- Initial NOI lists "Salvatore Vinci" not Delapa Properties
- Only corrected after multiple hearings
- Creates procedural questions about proper notice
4. The 2016 Settlement Execution
- Public body negotiating wetlands boundaries in closed session  
- Settlement negotiated in Executive Session (Nov 9)
- No public input on environmental compromise
- Settlement terms only revealed after signing
The substantive outcome
- Commission denied the ANRAD completely
- DEP upheld that denial
- Yet settlement gives Delapa an ORAD anyway (under bylaw only)      
- They got through settlement what they couldn't win on merits

The waiver of appeal rights
- Both sides gave up further administrative review
- Unusual to lock in a compromise on resource delineation
- No ability to revisit if conditions change

The overall pattern of a denied application morphing into an approved delineation through closed-door negotiations.

5. Critical property plotlines that deviate from historic precedent central to claims made in NOI

6. Claiming SOC #338-0706 Authority (Sept 2023)
- Goddard's response booklet claims dam work authorized by expired house permit
- It also states house work will be done while dam repair is being done

7. Limiting exposure to dam repair cost to $25k and then using that as a pretext for changing their aim to destroying the dam entirely.

8. Repetitive Continuances
- 2021: Monthly continuances with no new material (Jan-Mar)
- 2023: 6 months of "waiting for BETA review"
- Pattern suggests deliberate delay tactics

What Delapa Wanted (2014-2015):

  An ANRAD = "This is where we think the wetlands are"
  If approved → ORAD = "Official map of wetland boundaries, locked in for 3 years"

  What Actually Happened:

  Round 1: Local Level
  - Delapa: "Here's where we think the wetlands are" (minimal)
  - Conservation Commission: "No, the wetlands are much bigger than that"
  - DENIED (October 2015)

  Round 2: State Appeal
  - Delapa: "DEP, please overrule the local commission"
  - DEP: "We reviewed it. The Commission was right"
  - DENIED (August 2016)

  Round 3: The Lawsuit Threat
  - Delapa: "We'll sue everyone"
  - Behind closed doors: "What if we make a deal?"
  - Settlement: "OK, you can have your ORAD, but only under local rules, not state"
  - APPROVED through settlement (November 2016)

  The Key Point:

  They lost on the science (wetlands really were bigger) but won through legal pressure. The Town gave them officially-approved wetland boundaries to avoid a lawsuit, even though two separate reviews said those boundaries were wrong.

  It's like losing a game fair and square, then getting the trophy anyway because you threatened to sue the league.

#### 7. Strategic Positioning Questions

- Given the pattern of applications, what would trigger the Commission to consider this "repetitive" under regulations?
- How does the Commission view the segmentation of house vs. dam projects?
- What's the Commission's strategy if Delapa appeals another denial to DEP?

Community Concerns

- How can abutters/community members most effectively participate in future proceedings?
- Are there specific technical or environmental issues the Commission needs documented?
- Would additional peer review funding from concerned citizens be helpful?

Money Matters
- Who paid for BETA's peer review and the legal proceedings? (Follow the money = understand the pressure)
- Has the Town estimated its legal costs if this goes to another appeal?
- Would the Commission consider requiring a bond for dam repairs given the ownership dispute?

The Tactical Reality

- Off the record: Does the Commission feel the settlement tied their hands?
- What would need to change for the Commission to feel empowered to take a stronger stance?
- Are there other Town departments (DPW, Select Board) that could assert interests here?

#### 8. Things to follow up
The fact that they required re-notification after 5 months of review suggests something significant happened. Finding out what that was could be key.

Has the order been recorded in the registry of deeds?  No work shall be undertaken until the Order has become final and then has been recorded in the Registry of Deeds or the Land Court for the district in which the land is located, within the chain of title of the affected property.

##### Are all these points represented in the timeline??? DEP's Actual Record:

2016 ANRAD (#338-0594)
- DEP upheld the Conservation Commission's denial (Aug 30, 2016)     
- Delapa had to appeal this to an administrative hearing
- Only through settlement (not DEP decision) did they get the FORAD

2022 Single-Family Home (#338-0706)
- DEP issued Superseding Order of Conditions (May 6, 2022)
- This did overturn the Commission's denial
- But DEP required multiple rounds of information and revisions (Jan-May 2022)
- They specifically noted flood storage inconsistencies and  reserved right to raise additional issues

More Accurate Assessment:

The DEP appears to be:
1. Following technical standards strictly - they're not rubber-stamping Delapa's applications
2. Requiring substantial documentation - multiple information requests, site visits, revisions
3. Deferring to local authority on bylaws - the 2016 settlement preserved bylaw jurisdiction
4. Applying narrower criteria than the Commission - focusing on specific WPA performance standards rather than broader site difficulties

The pattern suggests DEP is institutionally constrained to evaluate whether narrow regulatory standards are met, while the Commission takes a more holistic view of site constraints. This isn't "siding with" so much as operating from different mandates.

The key tension: DEP evaluates "does this plan meet minimum standards?" while the Commission asks "should development happen here at all?"

Make Documents from emails and put them in the timeline. (remove appendices Document)
