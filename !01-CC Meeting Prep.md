July 23, 2025 - DEP #338-0756 Dam Restoration Project
[Speak clearly and calmly, with confidence]

Good evening, Commissioners. My name is Todd DeMelle, and I live at 1355 High Street, directly abutting Bakers Pond. I'm here to raise critical concerns about the dam restoration project before you tonight.

1. The Foundation of This Project Has Expired
The applicant's construction sequence, submitted in September 2023, states that Step 1 is: "Construction of access into the site per Superseding Order of Conditions DEP File #338-0706."

Addordint to the Superseding Order, it expired on May 6, 2025 - over two months ago. The applicant no longer has legal authorization to build the access infrastructure that their entire dam project depends upon.
[Pause for emphasis]
The Commission cannot approve a project based on an expired permit. The applicant must either:
Amend this NOI to include the wetland crossing, or Submit a new NOI for the crossing
Until they have valid authorization, any work in the wetlands would violate state regulations.

1. Page 9 of the SOC (at the bottom) states: "This Order is valid for three years from the date of issuance"
2. Page 9 of the SOC shows: "Date: 5-6-22" (May 6, 2022)

2. Dam Ownership Remains Contested
As acknowledged in your July 26, 2023 minutes, ownership of this dam is disputed. I maintain that the dam sits on my property, not the applicant's. It would be premature to approve repairs to a structure when ownership hasn't been legally established.

3. Pattern of Misrepresentation
This project represents the latest in a decade-long pattern of attempts to develop this property:

2015-2016: ANRAD denied, appealed to DEP
2020-2021: Single-family home denied by this Commission
2022: State overruled your denial with a Superseding Order
2023: Now seeking dam "restoration" that includes a permanent 10-foot access road
[Slight pause]
This isn't about dam safety - it's about building development infrastructure under the guise of environmental restoration.

4. Incomplete Peer Review
was the BETA group review of this project ever made public?  Ask BETA’s final peer‑review memo to be produced and posted before any new hearing opens. Demand it as part of the public record under G.L. c. 66 §10 Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 66, section 10 (public‑records law);

5. Outstanding Public Records Request
I filed a public records request on June 29, 2023 - over two years ago - for documents related to this property. The Town has never responded, violating state law. This lack of transparency undermines the integrity of this process.

In Closing
[Speak with conviction but remain respectful]

Commissioners, I urge you to:

Reject this application based on the expired permit foundation
Require the applicant to properly permit their wetland crossing
Wait for BETA to complete their review
Resolve the ownership dispute before approving any work
This property has a long history of regulatory violations and misrepresentations. Please don't allow another attempt to circumvent your authority through misleading applications.

Thank you for your time and careful consideration.

If Asked Follow-Up Questions:
Q: "How do you know the SOC expired?"
A: The Superseding Order was issued May 6, 2022, valid for three years. It expired May 6, 2025. Today is July 23, 2025.

Q: "What's your evidence of ownership?"
A: I have property surveys and historical documents showing the dam's location. I've previously provided this information to the Commission.

Q: "Why do you think this is about development?"
A: The 10-foot permanent access road, the staging area, and the infrastructure exactly match what was proposed for the denied residential development. The dam is non-functional rubble - this is about access, not restoration.

Q: "What about dam safety?"
A: If safety were the real concern, why keep the dam height at exactly 4.6 feet - just under the 6-foot threshold for state dam safety regulations? This is designed to avoid oversight, not ensure safety.

Key Documents to Bring:
Copy of the expired SOC showing May 6, 2022 date
September 2023 peer review response showing reliance on expired permit
Your original March 2016 email about dam ownership
Screenshot of outstanding FOIA request

The dam‑repair filing (NOI #338‑0756) still quotes:

Step 1
“Construction of access … per Superseding Order of Conditions (DEP #338‑0706) … This work is already permitted”.

That statement was true on 8 Sep 2023 (the date of this booklet), because the SOC for 0706 was then in force; it did not expire until 26 May 2025. If the applicant never filed a Form 7 extension, the 0706 permit has now lapsed, so the access road is no longer authorized.

“Any extension … shall be made on Form 7. The request must reach the issuing authority at least 30 days prior to expiration.” 310 CMR 10.05 (8)(a)‑(d) Title 310 of the Code of Massachusetts Regulations, section 10.05, subsection (8), paragraphs (a) through (d).

Implications

1. The construction sequence in NOI #338‑0756 is outdated.
2. Before any work proceeds the applicant must:
 • amend NOI #338‑0756 to include the wetland crossing, or
 • submit a new NOI solely for the crossing.
3. Until a fresh Order (or an extension issued before expiry) is in hand, any attempt to clear or fill the BVW would violate 310 CMR 10.05(6).   Title 310 of the Code of Massachusetts Regulations, section 10.05, subsection (6)

Next step: Ask the Commission to require an amended plan eliminating references to DEP #338‑0706 and re‑permitting the crossing under an active Order of Conditions.

Open FOIA request from 2023
https://www.townforms.com/FOIADirect-WestwoodMACitizens/Private/External/Request/RequestorDashboard.aspx

Any records relevant to 41 Mill St or abutting properties relative to the proposal to develop 42 Mill St that had been on the conservation commission agenda for 6/28 and that was continued to 7/12.

Request Sent: 06/29/2023 12:06 AM
Request Received: 06/29/2023 08:30 AM
Response Due by: 07/14/2023
Response:[Request is still open]


A public‑records request must receive a written response within 10 business days (G.L. c.66 §10(a)) 
Massachusetts General Court
.
No response for two years violates the law and is grounds to challenge the town’s handling of the project record.

Action

File an appeal with the Secretary of State’s Supervisor of Records (email: pre@sec.state.ma.us). Include your original request and proof of non‑response; the Supervisor can order production and impose fines 
Massachusetts Sec. of the Commonwealth
.

Send the same packet to MassDEP and note the missing records in any permitting comments; lack of transparency can weigh against the applicant’s submissions.

## Delapa's Strategy

The dam restoration project appears to be a strategic move to advance the development agenda through several mechanisms:

### Key Strategic Benefits:

1. Access Road Infrastructure
The NOI explicitly includes "Dam repair and access road" - this is the smoking gun. Building a road for "dam maintenance" creates permanent infrastructure that could later serve residential development.

2. Establishing Control 
By claiming responsibility for dam maintenance, Delapa:
- Asserts ownership over a contested boundary feature
- Justifies ongoing site access
- Creates precedent for property control

3. Regulatory Pathway
After multiple failed attempts at direct development:
- Pre-2015: Multiple rejections
- 2016: DEP upheld wetland restrictions
- 2021: Limited approval for single-family home     

The dam project represents a new approach - using environmental restoration as justification for infrastructure development.

4. Physical Site Changes
Dam work could:
- Alter water flow patterns
- Potentially affect wetland boundaries over time
- Create conditions for future regulatory reassessment

5. Less Opposition
"Dam maintenance" faces less community resistance than "residential development" even though both require similar infrastructure.        

### The Pattern:
1. Failed direct attempts →
2. Switch to "environmental" project →
3. Build access infrastructure →
4. Use infrastructure for future development        

This appears to be a classic case of achieving development goals incrementally through alternative regulatory pathways, using environmental restoration as cover for infrastructure development that primarily benefits future construction plans.

## Questions for Conservation Agent Karon Catrone

### Missing Key Documents
1. **Original ANRAD application materials (November 14, 2014, DEP #338-0594)** - What exactly did Delapa propose for wetland boundaries in the initial filing?
2. **July 8, 2020 Conservation Commission minutes** - The initial hearing for the single-family home proposal
3. **September 9, 2020 Conservation Commission minutes** - When peer review was ordered (we received July 22, 2020 minutes instead)
4. **October 14, 2020 Conservation Commission minutes** - Referenced in timeline but not in repository
5. **November 18, 2021 Written Order of Conditions (Denial)** - The formal denial document with specific findings
6. **November 2016 Settlement Agreement** - Between Delapa, Town, and DEP resolving the ANRAD appeal

### Historical Context Questions
1. **Dam ownership documentation** - What documents does the Town have regarding dam ownership? When did this become disputed?
2. **Pre-2014 development applications** - Don Foley mentioned "3 prior denials" at the October 28, 2015 meeting - what were these attempts?
3. **Dam maintenance history** - Has the dam ever been repaired? By whom? When? Are there any maintenance records?

### Current Status Questions
1. **Post-January 2024 status** - Has Delapa re-filed the dam NOI after being told to re-notify abutters on January 10, 2024?
2. **SOC #338-0706 expiration verification** - Can you confirm the expiration date? (Timeline shows May 6, 2025 but SOC was issued May 6, 2022)
3. **BETA peer review findings** - What specific issues did BETA identify with the dam project? Is their final report available?
4. **Form 7 extension** - Was a Form 7 extension filed for SOC #338-0706 before it expired?

### Procedural Questions
1. **Settlement terms** - Why did the 2016 settlement split the house approval from dam work? Was this a ConCom requirement?
2. **Enforcement concerns** - Has there been any unpermitted work or violations observed at 42 Mill Street?
3. **Beaver management** - What is the Town's position on beaver removal mentioned in the July 26, 2023 minutes?
4. **Access road specifications** - What are the exact dimensions and materials proposed for the "10-foot permanent access road"?

### Outstanding Issues
1. **Public records request** - Status of FOIA request filed June 29, 2023 (Request #unknown)
2. **Wetland boundary verification** - Have the wetland boundaries changed since the 2016 ORAD?
3. **Stream classification** - Is Mill Brook still classified as perennial per the 2015 peer review?
