## Appendix A  Dam Ownership & Maintenance Inquiry (Mar 2016)

### Email 1 - Todd DeMelle -> Karon Catrone   (19 Mar 2016 09:45 AM)

```
Hi Karon,

I attended a conservation committee meeting recently where the Bakers Pond dam at the site was mentioned as being in disrepair and the property owners' responsibility to maintain.

Looking at the GIS map (image attached), the stream flowing out from the pond is drawn through the neighboring plot suggesting the dam is on that property, but it always seemed to me as if the dam and stream were actually closer to our property.  I took the attached photos showing the state of the dam and marked the location of the shots using GPS.  It looks like the dam is pretty much right on the property line.

Questions
1. Which parcel owns the dam?
2. What responsibilities or permitting apply if the owner wants to repair it?

Thanks for your help, Karon.

Todd,

I remember your beetle project well and I'm glad it was a success.  I'm cc'ing the Town's attorney; this question is probably better addressed by him.  Let me know if there is anything I can do after hearing from him.

Hope all is well!

## Appendix B  Wetland Status Update & Neighbor Coordination (Apr 2016)

### Email 3 - Karon Catrone -> Greg Buckley   (27 Apr 2016 11:12 AM)

```
Greg,

Just an update on the status. We have to go back out to look at the plants; the vegetation was not growing when we were last there.

Karon

### Email 4 - Greg Buckley -> Neighbors   (29 Apr 2016 01:07 PM)

```
Hi everyone,

A few of us attended the Conservation Commission meeting the other night.  There wasn't a lot of new information, although I felt the Commission is adamant about that land not being developed and will fight the current efforts to do so.

They recommended we come up with a timeline of all the times a development plan has been brought and rejected, then draft a letter with resident signatures to help them defend their position.

Could those of you who have been in the neighborhood longer than me try to remember all the times this occurred?  I'm happy to draft the letter once we have the facts.

Thanks again for your help.

Greg
```

### Email 5 - Todd DeMelle -> Greg Buckley   (29 Apr 2016 02:44 PM)

```
Thanks, Greg.  We really appreciate you helming all this.  Let me know if we can help.

## Appendix C  DEP Superseding Order Circulation (Aug 2016)

### Email 6 - Greg Buckley -> Neighbors   (30 Aug 2016 02:28 PM)

```
Hi everyone,

I thought I would forward the decision from the DEP regarding the 42 Mill Street property.  Delapa had hired a consultant and asked the DEP to refute the town's assessment of the wetlands boundaries.  It sounds like the DEP is unwilling to rule any differently and confirms the area contains a perennial stream, which hopefully carries more stringent building requirements.

Bottom line--good news for us in protecting this wetland area.

Thanks for caring, and please keep us informed if you hear anything else.

Greg

## Appendix D  DEP Appeal & Scheduling (Sep 2016)

### Email 7 - Karon Catrone -> Greg Buckley   (19 Sep 2016 12:49 PM)

```
Greg,

Just wanted to keep you updated.  The applicant has appealed DEP's decision.  I have forwarded this information to the Town's attorney.

Karon
```

### Email 8 - Greg Buckley -> Karon Catrone   (20 Sep 2016 09:20 AM)

```
Hi Karon,

So Delapa is appealing DEP's decision.  If they're appealing, who hears that appeal and what role does the Town of Westwood have?

Thanks.

Greg
```

### Email 9 - Karon Catrone -> Greg Buckley   (20 Sep 2016 09:32 AM)

```
Hi Greg,

DEP's Office of Appeals & Dispute Resolution will hear it.  The Town and DEP will both defend the decision.  Town Counsel and I will attend.

Karon
```

### Email 10 - Greg Buckley -> Neighbors   (20 Sep 2016 04:32 PM)

```
Hello everyone, it looks like Delapa is still fighting this.  Hearing set for Jan 24 2017.  Karon will let us know if neighbors should attend.

Greg
```

### Email 11 - Tom Palmer -> Greg Buckley   (20 Sep 2016 06:35 PM)

```
I just looked at the Superseding Order and don't see how it could be improved from your POV since DEP affirmed all the town's determinations.  DEP reversals are rare, but because the payoff is significant the developer may proceed anyway.

## Appendix E  Applicant Name Change & Peer-Review Responses (Oct 2020)

*(Thread condensed: identical "Thank you" replies removed.)*

### Email 12 - Tim McGuire -> Karon Catrone   (13 Oct 2020 12:10 PM)

```
Good afternoon Karon,

We realized there was an inconsistency with the applicant for this NOI.  The applicant is Delapa Properties, not Salvatore Vinci.  See attached revised WPA Form 3 for clarification.

We would also like to continue tomorrow's hearing (10/14) to the next available date.  Please advise on the date of this next hearing.

Do you have any updates from the peer reviewer?

Thank you,

Tim McGuire
```

### Email 13 - Karon Catrone -> Tim McGuire   (26 Oct 2020 01:46 PM)

```
Hi Tim,

Because we have not received any revised materials you will be continuing the hearing until November 18 2020.

Karon
```

### Email 14 - Tim McGuire -> Karon Catrone   (26 Oct 2020 01:57 PM)

```
Karon,

We have been in contact with the peer reviewer and would like to proceed with the hearing this Wednesday to discuss the comments.  We also have updated information on directional drilling.

Please let us know if you have any concerns.

Tim
```

### Email 15 - Karon Catrone -> Tim McGuire   (26 Oct 2020 02:13 PM)

```
Tim,

I will keep you on the agenda for discussion, but because the Commission has not seen any updated material, the project will more than likely be continued to give them time to review any new information.

Karon
```

### Email 16 - Tim McGuire -> Karon Catrone   (27 Oct 2020 04:46 PM)

```
Attached please find our responses to the comments from the peer reviewer, GEC.  Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you,

Tim
```

### Email 17 - Greg Buckley -> Todd DeMelle   (28 Oct 2020 11:37 AM)

Todd,

Here is the applicant's response to the consultant.  Are you able to attend the Zoom meeting tonight?

## Appendix F  Dam Repair NOI Inquiry (May 2023)

### Email 18 - Todd DeMelle -> Karon Catrone   (27 May 2023 04:26 PM)

```
Hi Karon!

Happy Summer!  I just received the certified mail notification regarding the intent to repair the Baker's Pond dam.  Is there more detail on what repairing it means?  With the beaver activity recently, the pond is as full as I've ever seen it.

It also seems a good time to follow up on my old question about where the dam falls relative to plot lines.  Photos and GPS points attached again.

Thanks for any thoughts or details you can provide.  I hope all's well!

-- Todd
