Suffolk University

INTAKE SUMMARY — DEP #338-0706 (Lot 2B Mill St., Westwood MA)
Client: Todd DeMelle, 1355 High St, Westwood MA 02090 │ 617-462-9195 │ tdemelle@gmail.com

1  Project & Procedural Setting
Applicant Delapa Realty Trust seeks a Notice of Intent (NOI) to „restore“ (remove) Bakers Pond dam and develop upstream land (Lot 2B, 42 Mill St).

Hearings before Westwood Conservation Commission are ongoing; MassDEP file #338-0706.

Four discrete defects in the filings reveal a pattern of misrepresentation that threatens the pond, my property rights, and wetland interests.

2  Contested Issues (each supported by a stand-alone letter & exhibits)
#	Issue	Core Defect	Legal Hook
1	Dam Removal	NOI frames removal as “restoration” yet omits hydraulic, hazard, and downstream impacts.	310 CMR 10.04 & 10.53(4)
2	Omission of Land Under Water (LUW)	Plans label entire pond as BVW; no LUW impacts quantified.	310 CMR 10.56 performance standards
3	Parcel Boundary / Dam Ownership Fraud	Stamped plans shift lot line to seize my dam; deeds & MassGIS show dam on my parcel.	310 CMR 10.05(4)(a) (owner signature); M.G.L. c. 267 §5
4	Expired Superseding Order of Conditions (SOC)	Applicant relies on MassDEP SOC expired in 2019; using it to justify new work.	310 CMR 10.05(4)(b); DEP Guidance 85-1

3  Client Objectives
Immediate: Force Commission to deny or suspend NOI until defects cured and true ownership resolved.

Mid-term: Quiet-title action to confirm dam lies on my parcel; injunctive relief against trespass or demolition.

Long-term: Establish enforceable protections preventing future development that harms Bakers Pond ecosystem.

4  Requested Legal Services
Administrative advocacy: Draft testimony, appear at Commission hearings, file MassDEP appeal if permit issues.

Property litigation: Quiet-title & slander-of-title suit in Land Court; injunction if needed.

Strategic coordination: Integrate historic records (1966/1969 deed plans, MassGIS, peer reviews) and prepare referrals to Board of Registration & AG Environmental Crimes Strike Force.

5  Attached / Available Materials
Four issue letters with exhibits index (PDF, 35 pp).

Deed surveys (1966, 1969), MassGIS overlays, GLM plan overlays.

6  Urgency
Next Commission hearing expected within 4 weeks; written comments due 7 days prior. Need counsel promptly to consolidate evidence, draft motion to deny for lack of standing, and prepare for possible appeal.
