RE: WETLANDS/WESTWOOD  
     DEP File #338-0706  
     42 Mill Street  
     Superseding Order of Conditions  

Dear Ms. Delapa,

Following an in-depth review of the file referenced above, and in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 131, Section 40, the Northeast Regional Office of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, Wetlands Program (MassDEP), is issuing the enclosed Superseding Order of Conditions (SOC) approving the project. This SOC allows the project based upon: 1) information contained in the file to date and plans submitted; 2) information gathered during the site inspection; and 3) reasons MassDEP has deemed necessary to protect the statutory interests identified in the Wetlands Protection Act (the "Act") and Regulations.

The project site is located at 42 Mill Street in Westwood, MA (Map 28, Lot 013). It consists of approximately 4.0 acres of currently undeveloped forested land that was established since 1969. The project site is bordered by residences to the north, east, south, and west. The adjacent lot located to the north, known as lot 2A, is host to a shared common driveway which exists within a Right of Way easement on that property. This shared common driveway will be utilized to access the project site. A perennial stream known as Mill Brook flows onto the property from the north and into Bakers Pond which is centrally located on the project site. Mill Brook then flows out of Bakers Pond in the southwesterly direction off-site. The dwelling is proposed in the only upland area located on the western portion of the project site.

The project as proposed in the Notice of Intent (NOI) filed with the Westwood Conservation Commission (WCC) on June 18, 2020, consists of the construction of a single-family home, bituminous driveway, repaving the existing shared common driveway, lawn, grading, landscaping and installation of water and sewer utilities via directional drilling. In order to install the bituminous driveway, approximately 550 square feet of Bordering Vegetated Wetlands (BVW) will be filled. In order to mitigate for the filling of BVW, the project proposes to create approximately 700 square feet of BVW. The proposed driveway will result in unquantified amounts of fill in Bordering Land Subject to Flooding (BLSF). In addition, no compensatory flood storage was proposed based on the plan submitted with the NOI. The project site contains approximately 115,054 square feet of Riverfront Area. The proposed project will result in approximately 10,702 square feet of new permanent alteration within the outer riparian zone of the 200-foot Riverfront Area. The proposed project will also result in approximately 4,801 square feet of temporary impacts to the 200-foot Riverfront Area for work associated with re-paving the common driveway. Of the 4,801 square feet of temporary impacts to the 200-foot Riverfront Area, 2,744 square feet will be located in the inner riparian zone and 2,057 square feet will be located in the outer riparian zone.

On December 19, 2016, MassDEP issued a Final Order of Resource Area Delineation (FORAD), DEP File #338-0594, for the project site. The FORAD received an Extension Permit on December 24, 2019, with a new expiration date of December 19, 2022.

On November 18, 2021, the WCC issued an Order of Conditions (OOC) denying the project based on its opinion that the proposed project could not be conditioned to meet the performance standards set forth in the Regulations or the local Bylaw. Specifically, the WCC claims that the project does not meet the performance standards established in 310 CMR 10.55 and 310 CMR 10.58 for BVW and Riverfront Area, respectively.

On December 1, 2021, MassDEP received your appeal of the OOC/Denial for issuance of a Superseding Order of Conditions. The appeal states that it is your opinion the proposed project meets the performance standards established in 310 CMR 10.55 and 310 CMR 10.58. Specifically, you state that the project involves 550 sq. ft. of wetland fill and 700 sq. ft. of wetland replication which is more than the required 1:1 wetland replication requirement established in 310 CMR 10.55(4)(b)(1). Additionally, you state that the WCC incorrectly calculated the amount of impact to the Riverfront Area. You state that in the NOI, you provided the accurate amount of impacts to Riverfront Area based on the location of the Riverfront Area approved under the FORAD and demonstrated how the proposed project meets the performance standards established in 310 CMR 10.58(4).

On January 6, 2022, MassDEP conducted a site visit. In attendance were your representative, a representative from the WCC and their third-party reviewer. At the site visit, MassDEP discussed the project and observed the areas where work is proposed.

MassDEP's review of the file and site visit confirms that the project site contains the following Areas Subject to Protection Under the Act: BVW, Inland Bank, LUW, Riverfront Area associated with Mill Brook, and BLSF. These areas are significant to the statutory interests listed on the attached form. Portions of the proposed project will occur within the 100-foot inner riparian zone and the 200-foot outer riparian zone of the Riverfront Area, BVW, BLSF (FEMA flood Map 25021C0178E, eff. 7/17/2012), and associated buffer zones.

Pursuant to 310 CMR 10.58(4)(d)1 the issuing authority may allow the alteration of up to 5000 square feet or 10% of the 200-foot riverfront area within the lot, whichever is greater, on a lot recorded on or before October 6,1997 or lots recorded after October 6, 1997. The project site contains approximately 115,054 square feet of Riverfront Area. The proposed project will result in approximately 10,702 square feet of new permanent alteration within the 200-foot Riverfront Area. The permanent impacts to Riverfront Area are less than 10% (11,505 square feet) of the total square footage of Riverfront Area on the parcel. The proposed project will also result in approximately 4,801 square feet of temporary impacts to the 200-foot Riverfront Area associated with re-paving the common driveway.

To access the only buildable upland area on the project site from the common shared driveway, an individual driveway is proposed to be constructed that involves crossing an existing area of BVW and BLSF. A 12" reinforced concrete pipe will be placed at the crossing to maintain a hydrologic connection between two areas of BVW. As stated in the NOI the proposed crossing will result in approximately 550 square feet of BVW fill with 700 square feet of BVW replication. In accordance with 310 CMR 10.55(4)(b) the issuing authority may permit work that will result in the loss of up to 5000 square feet of BVW when the replacement area to be created equals that of the area to be lost. As currently proposed, the project will create an additional 150 square feet of BVW which exceeds the minimum 1:1 replication ratio.

Upon review of plan Sheet 1 of 3 entitled, "Proposed Site Plan of Land Lot 2B- Mill Street Westwood, Massachusetts," prepared by GLM Engineering Consultants, Inc., dated November 2, 2018, and revised July 3, 2021, no amount of alteration in BLSF for portions of the proposed individual driveway or amount of compensatory flood storage was shown. Therefore, on January 11, 2022, MassDEP issued an information request letter asking you to quantify impacts to BLSF and the amount of compensatory flood storage to be provided in accordance with performance standards under 310 CMR 10.57(4).

On February 8, 2022, your representative submitted a response to MassDEP's request by providing a response letter and a revised plan set (3) with a revision date of January 31, 2022. The revised plans show the location and amount of fill to be placed in BLSF and the location and amount of compensatory flood storage to be provided. As stated in the response approximately 285 cubic feet of fill will be placed in BLSF between elevations 193.5-194, for portions of the proposed driveway. Approximately 380 cubic feet of compensatory flood storage will be provided between elevations 193.5-194, a net incremental increase of 95 cubic feet of compensatory flood storage. On February 23, 2022, MassDEP requested you to provide a cut and fill table as requested in the January 11, 2022 information request letter. On February 25, 2022, your representative submitted a BLSF cut/fill chart.

On March 7, 2022, MassDEP issued another information request letter requesting you to clarify the floodplain elevations shown on the project plans as it appeared to be inconsistent with the topography on the property.

On March 14, 2022, your representative submitted a response to MassDEP addressing the noted concerns with a new revised plan set with a revision date of March 8, 2022. Your representative corrected the floodplain previously listed as Zone A instead of the correct Zone AE with a BFE of 190', 191', and 194'.

Based on the information and plans contained in the file, information gathered at the site inspection, and consideration of all issues raised through the appeal, it is MassDEP's opinion that the project as currently proposed meets performance standards under 310 CMR 10.55(4), 310 CMR 10.57(4)(a), and 310 CMR 10.58(4), for BVW, BLSF and Riverfront Area, respectively. It is MassDEP's opinion that the enclosed SOC approving this project serves to protect the interests of the Act and Regulations. Please be advised that it is MassDEP's responsibility to address only those interests identified in the Act. However, MassDEP reserves the right, should there be further proceedings in this case, to raise additional issues and present further evidence as may be appropriate. Should you or any concerned party dispute these findings, your attention is directed to the language at the end of the attached Superseding Order specifying the rights and procedures for appeal.

Should you have any questions regarding this letter, please contact Tyler Ferrick at Tyler.Ferrick@mass.gov.

Sincerely,

### C. General Conditions Under Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act

Brief Project Description of Permitted Activities:
Construction of a single-family home and appurtenant amenities. A shared common driveway exists adjacent to the site in which will be used as the primary access drive to the residence with an individual driveway constructed off the shared common driveway to give access to the residence. The private driveway will result in 550 sq. ft. of BVW fill. A 700 sq. ft. foot wetland replication area is proposed which will result in a net increase of 150 sq. ft. of BVW onsite. The wetland crossing will also result in 285 cubic feet of fill in BLSF (El. 193.5-194). Construction of a 380 cubic foot compensatory flood storage area is proposed which is a net incremental increase of 95 cubic feet of compensatory flood storage. Total Riverfront Area onsite is 115,054 square feet. The existing common drive being repaved equates to 4,801 sq. ft. of temporary impacts to Riverfront Area. New permanent impacts to the Riverfront Area as a result of this project amounts to 10,702 sq. ft.

Within thirty (30) days of the completion of constructing the BVW replication area and area of compensatory flood storage, the EM shall prepare and submit to MassDEP (at Tyler.Ferrick@mass.gov) a written narrative with photographs of the work that was performed and an inventory of the plant media that was installed.

46. The EM shall submit weekly reports to MassDEP with copies sent to the WCC immediately upon the start of work. These reports shall summarize the site activities within the BVW, BLSF, Riverfront Areas and the 100-foot Buffer Zone, and shall confirm that all activities are in compliance with the conditions of this Superseding Order. The reports shall include, but are not limited to, a description of construction status and activities; overall site conditions; the condition of erosion and sedimentation controls; BVW and BLSF activities; and reports of any erosion, sedimentation, or pollution problems and how they were corrected, along with recommendations on how to prevent similar problems in the future. The EM shall immediately report any unauthorized discharges of sediments to MassDEP and the WCC, and the applicant shall take immediate steps to correct the problem.

47. Upon completion of construction, the EM shall submit monthly reports to MassDEP with copies sent to the WCC to indicate whether the site is in compliance with the conditions of this Superseding Order. These monthly reports shall be submitted until such time that erosion is no longer a concern due to seasonal conditions and the applicant submits a written request to MassDEP to temporarily cease monitoring. The monthly monitoring reports shall include, but are not limited to, a description of overall site conditions; the condition of erosion and sedimentation controls; and actions taken to address problems and any other recommendations for site management. The EM shall immediately report any unauthorized discharges of sediments to MassDEP, and the applicant shall take immediate steps to correct the problem.

48. The EM shall monitor the BVW replication area for three (3) years of full continuous growing seasons, with written reports submitted to MassDEP and copied to the WCC no later than October 31st of each calendar year. A Certificate of Compliance will not be issued until this condition has been met.

    Monitoring reports shall include photographic stations for "before" and "after" photographic documentation that clearly and comprehensively describe the conditions of the BVW replication area. The report should describe the presence of any visible hydrology; soil profile; the stability, health, growth, and vigor of the planted species; and any enhancement activities performed or remedial actions necessary to be undertaken within the BVW replication area. At least 75 percent of the replication areas shall be reestablished with wetland plant species within three growing seasons. Any plants that die shall be promptly replaced with a similar plant species.

    All reports shall be sent to:
    Tyler Ferrick
    MassDEP Wetlands Program
    Northeast Regional Office
    205B Lowell Street
    Wilmington, MA 01887
    or via email to Tyler.Ferrick@mass.gov

    and shall reference the DEP File No. 338-0706 and shall be copied to the WCC.

49. If monitoring data indicates that the BVW replication area is failing, a corrective plan shall be submitted to MassDEP for review and approval. Upon approval, the corrective plan shall be implemented under the direct supervision of the EM or other wetland scientist.

50. At the start of work, additional erosion control materials shall be available on site (stored under cover) for emergency and routine replacement.

51. Erosion controls shall serve as the limit of work and shall be maintained in good repair until disturbed areas have been fully stabilized with vegetation or other means acceptable to MassDEP. At no time shall sediments be deposited in a wetland resource area.

52. MassDEP shall be immediately notified of any unauthorized discharges of sediments into the wetland resource areas, and the applicant shall take immediate steps to correct the problem. MassDEP reserves the right to require additional erosion controls and/or damage prevention controls that are deemed necessary.

53. Erosion controls shall remain in place until MassDEP approves their removal.

54. Wetland flags shall be maintained at all times and replaced if they are missing until Certificate of Compliance has been issued.

55. Discharges from any dewatering activities, if necessary, shall not cause scouring or erosion of BVW or Buffer Zone.

56. All soil stockpiles to be stored longer than 24-hours shall be surrounded by erosion controls, and any soil stockpiles that are left idle for more than 14 days shall be temporarily stabilized with a seed mix and tackifier.

57. All heavy equipment shall be stored beyond the limits of the delineated wetland resource areas and confined to the upland side of the erosion controls.

58. Excess soils, rock and debris excavated or generated during the course of this project shall be removed from the site and disposed in a legal manner. Records of the destination of all materials, including excess fill and loam, to be removed from the site shall be kept on file and shall be provided to MassDEP and the WCC upon request.

59. At no time during or after construction shall fill or other material be placed, slump into or fall beyond the limit of grading as shown on the plan. The applicant and its EM shall be responsible for inspecting and maintaining all slopes and shall immediately notify the MassDEP and the WCC if slumping, erosion, or encroachment occurs.

60. Storing, servicing, or cleaning of equipment, including but not limited to fueling, changing, adding, or applying lubricants or hydraulic fluids, or washing/rinsing of trucks or equipment, shall be performed outside the 100-foot Buffer Zone unless prior authorization is obtained from MassDEP.

61. There shall be no discharge or spillage of fuel, oil, or other pollutants, including sediments, onto any part of the site. The applicant shall take all reasonable precautions to prevent the release of pollutants by ignorance, accident, or vandalism.

62. Immediately upon completion of construction, all exposed soils shall be seeded with appropriate vegetation or otherwise stabilized by a method acceptable to MassDEP. Where necessary, loam and seed shall be held in place using jute matting or other biodegradable materials for permanent stabilization against soil erosion. All materials not to remain on the site shall be removed and disposed of in a legal manner.

63. Upon completion of the project, the applicant shall request a Certificate of Compliance (WPA Form 8A) from MassDEP and shall submit the following information with the request:
    a. A written statement prepared and signed by a professional engineer registered in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts certifying compliance with the approved plans referenced above and this Superseding Order and setting forth deviations if any exist;
    b. An as-built site plan prepared and stamped by a registered professional engineer in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts showing the location and grades of the project, including, but not limited to: the wetland crossing, dwelling, utilities, driveway, and topography shown in one (1) foot contours. The as-built plan shall also include the wetland flags and the date(s) of survey.
    c. An as-built plan prepared by a registered land surveyor or registered professional engineer of the BVW replication area and area of compensatory flood storage with topography shown in one (1) foot contours. These plans shall include wetland flags, a notation of the amount of BVW replicated and compensatory flood storage provided; at least three (3) photographs of each area with the date(s) they were taken; and the date(s) of survey. The plan shall be accompanied by a final report by the EM describing the condition of the BVW replication area, including a list of the surviving plants (with the quantity of each species), relative health of the plantings and soil profiles.
