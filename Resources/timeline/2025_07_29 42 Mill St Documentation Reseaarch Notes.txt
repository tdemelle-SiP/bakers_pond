 -"A significant portion of Mill Brook including the impoundment at the site is within the Interim Wellhead Protection Area of a Public Water Supply (PWS) well at Buckmaster Pond in Westwood. In the absence of an approved Zone II recharge area, DEP has adopted the Interim Wellhead Protection Area (IWPA) as the primary, protected recharge area for PWS groundwater sources. The IWPA radius for the PWS well at Buckmaster Pond is 0.5 miles."

definitive conclusion that Mill Brook is a perennial stream.

There are no confirmed potential or designated vernal pools registered by the Natural Heritage Program (CONTACT NATURAL HERITAGE PROGRAM)
