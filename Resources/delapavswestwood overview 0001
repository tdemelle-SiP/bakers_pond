  May 11, 2020: Initial Filing

  Action: Delapa files NOI for single-family home (DEP
  #338-0706)
  - Legal: Standard procedure - proper filing under both WPA        
  and local bylaw
  - Environmental: Proposed work in sensitive wetland area with     
   Mill Brook
  - Integrity: Straightforward application, no red flags

  July 2020 - October 2021: Extended Review Period (16 months)      

  Action: Conservation Commission holds multiple hearings,
  orders peer review
  - Legal: Commission following proper procedures, using peer       
  review authority
  - Environmental: GEC peer reviewer identifies wetland
  boundaries different from 2016 DEP determination
  - Integrity: Long review suggests thorough evaluation, though     
   raises questions about why boundaries differ from state
  determination

  October 18, 2021: Strategic Withdrawal

  Action: Delapa withdraws application under local bylaw,
  maintains WPA application
  - Legal: Clever maneuver - attempting to limit Commission's       
  authority to WPA-only review
  - Environmental: No change to actual project impacts
  - Integrity: Legal gamesmanship - using procedural tactics to     
   avoid stricter local standards

  November 10, 2021: Commission Votes Despite Withdrawal

  Action: Commission holds hearing and votes to deny under both     
   WPA and local bylaw
  - Legal: Questionable - voting on withdrawn application
  appears to exceed authority
  - Environmental: Commission stands by findings of
  unacceptable impacts
  - Integrity: Commission appears to force the issue rather
  than accept withdrawal

  November 18, 2021: Formal Denial Issued

  Action: Written Order of Conditions denying project
  Key findings:
  - 26,638 sq ft of resource area impacts
  - Cannot meet performance standards
  - Legal: Procedurally suspect given withdrawal
  - Environmental: Strong stance protecting resources
  - Integrity: Commission putting environmental protection over     
   procedural correctness

  December 1, 2021: Dual-Track Response

  Action: Delapa simultaneously:
  1. Appeals to DEP
  2. Files lawsuit in Superior Court
  - Legal: Aggressive but legitimate use of available remedies      
  - Environmental: Seeking more favorable venue (state vs
  local)
  - Integrity: Well-funded applicant using all available
  pressure points

  January 12, 2022: Superior Court Complaint Filed

  Action: Formal complaint alleging Commission acted "ultra
  vires"
  Claims:
  - Commission exceeded authority
  - Made errors of law and fact
  - Ignored binding FORAD
  - Legal: Strong procedural arguments about Commission
  overreach
  - Environmental: Sidesteps environmental merits
  - Integrity: Focus on technicalities rather than substantive      
  concerns

  April 20, 2022: Town's Defensive Response

  Action: Commission files Answer denying all substantive
  allegations
  Approach: Boilerplate denials, affirmative defenses
  - Legal: Standard litigation tactics but weak on substance        
  - Environmental: No defense of their environmental findings       
  - Integrity: Defensive posture suggests awareness of
  procedural weakness

  May 6, 2022: DEP Bombshell

  Action: DEP issues Superseding Order approving project
  Key differences from Commission:
  - Only 550 sq ft BVW impact (vs 26,638 sq ft claimed)
  - Extensive conditions but finds project can meet standards       
  - Legal: State authority trumps local
  - Environmental: Dramatically different wetland
  interpretation
  - Integrity: Either Commission or DEP has seriously misread       
  the site

  September 8, 2022: Settlement Talks

  Action: Parties report "agreement in principle"
  - Legal: Practical recognition that DEP decision makes
  lawsuit moot
  - Environmental: Not mentioned in settlement discussions
  - Integrity: Both sides looking for face-saving exit

  September 12, 2022: The Missing Letter

  Reference: Goddard Consulting letter about dam (not in file)      
  - Legal: Becomes basis for settlement terms
  - Environmental: Dam issues apparently identified
  - Integrity: Suspicious that this key document is missing

  October 26, 2022: Settlement Agreement

  Terms:
  1. Commission accepts DEP decision
  2. Delapa pays up to $25,000 for dam repair
  3. New NOI required for dam work
  4. Building permit contingent on dam NOI filing

  Analysis:
  - Legal: Face-saving compromise - Commission drops fight,
  Delapa accepts new obligation
  - Environmental: Dam repair adds environmental benefit not in     
   original plan
  - Integrity: Horse-trading - dam repair appears unrelated to      
  wetland issues

  May 23, 2023: Dam NOI Filed

  Action: Delapa files required dam NOI (DEP #338-0756)
  - Legal: Fulfilling settlement obligation
  - Environmental: Claims "restoration" but includes 10-foot        
  access road
  - Integrity: Using required dam work to build permanent
  infrastructure

  June 23, 2023: Case Dismissed

  Action: Formal dismissal with prejudice
  - Legal: All claims resolved
  - Environmental: Original wetland concerns never adjudicated      
  - Integrity: Environmental protection subordinated to legal       
  settlement

  Key Observations

  Legal Perspective

  - Commission likely did exceed authority by voting after
  withdrawal
  - Delapa used sophisticated legal strategy to forum-shop
  - Settlement avoided court ruling on merits

  Environmental Perspective

  - Massive discrepancy between local/state wetland assessments     
   never resolved
  - Environmental concerns became bargaining chips
  - Dam repair only environmental "win" but wasn't related to       
  original impacts

  Integrity Assessment

  - Commission: Tried to protect wetlands but used questionable     
   procedures
  - Delapa: Used every legal tool available; pattern of
  persistent development attempts
  - DEP: Dramatic reversal of local findings raises questions       
  about thoroughness
  - Settlement: Both parties compromised principles for
  practical resolution

  For Your Position

  This history shows:
  1. Delapa will use all available legal/regulatory avenues
  2. Local environmental protection can be overridden by state      
  3. Settlement terms can introduce unrelated obligations
  4. Missing documents (Sept 12 letter) may contain important       
  details
  5. Property boundary issues (dam location) remain unaddressed
