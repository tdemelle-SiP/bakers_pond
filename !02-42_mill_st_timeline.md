## Influence balance (derived from filings)

| Influence | Evidence & effect | Who prevailed |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| **Procedural law** | Complaint centers on withdrawal right, FORAD supremacy, by‑law equivalence. Judge’s status orders push settlement. | **Delapa** gained leverage; Commission ceded WPA fight. |
| **Environmental integrity** | Commission’s denial cites large resource impacts; plaintiff never refutes numbers—argues process. Settlement splits dam vs. house, leaving real wetland alteration to later NOI. | **Mixed:** Town retains by‑law review for dam; house proceeds under SOC. |
| **Money & time** | No motions, discovery, or trial. Multiple continuances, quick dismissal. Each side pays own fees. | **Both saved costs**, but Delapa secures project path; town avoids fee liability. |
| **State authority vs. local autonomy** | DEP FORAD (2016) & SOC (2022) underpin plaintiff’s case; settlement forces Commission to adopt SOC. | **State standards trump local** for house/crossing; local retains dam oversight (for now). |

**Overall:** Legal‐procedural leverage and cost‑containment prevailed. The Commission’s environmental concerns were sidelined in court and partially parked in a future NOI, reflecting a strategy where **process wins over substance** when litigation risk and expense loom.


---

## Condensed Essence of the Litigation (added for quick reference)

**Core dispute** – Delapa’s single‑family‑home NOI was denied by the Commission under both the Wetlands Protection Act (WPA) and Westwood’s wetlands by‑law. She claims the Commission ignored a 2016 DEP Final ORAD, refused her withdrawal request, and applied no standards beyond WPA.

**Legal strategy** – The 31‑page complaint focuses on procedural error: certiorari to overturn the denial and declaratory counts to nullify the by‑law’s reach. This moved leverage from local regulators to Superior Court with modest filing costs.

**Commission stance** – The written denial cites 26 638 sf of wetland impacts, designates the on‑site stream perennial, and flags driveway/buffer violations—an integrity position grounded in broader wetland boundaries.

**Settlement mechanics** – Faced with repeated status‑review warnings (Aug 2022–Mar 2023) and rising litigation costs, the parties struck a deal on 26 Oct 2022: Commission adopts DEP Superseding OOC #338‑0706 (house & crossing approved); Delapa files a new NOI for dam work capped at $25 000.

**Outcome** – Joint dismissal with prejudice on 22 Jun 2023; each side bears its own fees. Procedural leverage and cost containment prevail: Delapa secures access & house, Commission retains dam oversight under its by‑law.

**Influence balance**
- *Process & state authority* overrode local environmental rigor.
- *Money/time efficiency* drove settlement pre‑motion.
- *Environmental integrity questions* (large impacts, perennial‑stream dispute) remain untested until dam‑repair NOI review.
