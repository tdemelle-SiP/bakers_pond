Dam maintenance

-what problem is this solving?  Why was this made a condition of DEP #388-0706 ?

-why are there no sizes of alterations in section B of the WPA Form 3?

-the plan shows that Baker's Pond is all BVW and no LUW

## 2. Contest Order

FORAD  C:\Users\tdeme\Repositories\bakers_pond\Resources\timeline\2016_12_19 delapawet2016-022fd_OCR.pdf

step‚Äëby‚Äëstep plan for challenging or supplementing the FORAD so that the LUW status of Bakers Pond is properly considered:

üîπ 1. Gather Strong Evidence of LUW
Photographs: Show Bakers Pond as open water in typical years (not dominated by vegetation).

Historical imagery: Use MassGIS aerial layers (available free online) to show long‚Äëterm open water.

MassGIS/National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) maps: Download the layer classifying Bakers Pond as Freshwater Pond (LUW).

Eyewitness record: Your 21 years of observation, noting only temporary drying in extreme summers.

üîπ 2. Commission a Wetland Scientist
Hire a professional wetland scientist to flag boundaries:

Document vegetation (or lack thereof).

Conduct soil cores to show it‚Äôs a pond basin, not hydric soils dominated by wetland vegetation.

A certified delineation carries much more weight than abutter testimony alone.

üîπ 3. File for DEP Review (Superseding Order)
Any abutter or aggrieved party can request a Superseding Order of Conditions (SOC) from MassDEP.

DEP will send its own staff to the site to review the delineation.

This bypasses the local Conservation Commission if they are locked into the 2016 FORAD.

üîπ 4. Highlight Legal Requirements in Writing
In a letter to the Westwood Conservation Commission and DEP:

Quote 310 CMR 10.56: ‚ÄúLand under any pond‚Ä¶‚Äù

Point out that the 2016 FORAD never addressed LUW, only BVW and Riverfront.

Argue the NOI therefore fails to meet LUW performance standards, since replication is not permitted under 10.56.

Request that LUW impacts be evaluated separately from BVW.

üîπ 5. Use the Riverfront Area Filing Against Them
They checked the 200 ft Riverfront Area box (115,054 sf).

Riverfront jurisdiction only applies if there is a pond/stream = LUW.

Their own filing is implicit acknowledgment that Bakers Pond is a pond, not just BVW.

üîπ 6. Procedural Avenues
Motion to Amend or Invalidate the FORAD: If new evidence shows the 2016 delineation was materially inaccurate.

Public Comment on NOI: Submit evidence that the NOI ignores LUW.

DEP Petition: Ask DEP to clarify LUW applicability, citing MassGIS data and your scientist‚Äôs delineation.

‚öñÔ∏è Practical Goal
You don‚Äôt necessarily need to overturn the whole FORAD.
Your aim is to force recognition of LUW in addition to BVW, which removes replication as a compliance path and raises the regulatory bar for the driveway project.
