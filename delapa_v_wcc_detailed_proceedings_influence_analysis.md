**Norfolk Superior Court No. 2282CV00038** — *Blow‑by‑blow drawn only from user‑supplied OCR PDFs*

| Date | Procedural / factual step (verbatim cite ⇢) | Legal meaning | Environmental‑integrity angle | Strategic / power influence |
|------|---------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **18 Oct 2021** | *“Applicant hereby withdraws its local‑by‑law Notice of Intent…”* (p. 8 ¶38) | Tries to remove local by‑law jurisdiction before any vote. | Signals preference for state‑level (WPA) review only. | Procedural gambit: avoid stricter town standards & potential litigation cost. |
| **10 Nov 2021** | *“Commission voted 7‑0 to deny under WPA **and** By‑law.”* (p. 8 ¶39) | Board refuses withdrawal & issues denial anyway. | Presents itself as protecting 26 638 sf of resources incl. perennial stream. | Commission flexes authority—provokes higher‑forum contest. |
| **18 Nov 2021** | Written **Order of Conditions (Denial)** issued; cites 26 638 sf total impact, perennial stream, 10 ft NDZ. (Order attach. pp. 2‑3) | Final agency action ripe for appeal. | Frames project as major BVW / riverfront threat. | Creates appealable record; sets stage for certiorari. |
| **12 Jan 2022** | **Petition for Certiorari & Declaratory Relief** filed (31 pp). Counts: 1 (certiorari), 2 (declaratory—by‑law ≠ stricter), 3 (declaratory—Commission lacked withdrawal discretion). (p. 11 ¶¶51‑56) | Opens Superior Ct. oversight; seeks reversal & order to approve. | Attacks procedure, not science; alleges Commission ignored binding 2016 **FORAD**. | High leverage: small filing fee vs. big risk to town.  |
| **31 Mar 2022** | Affidavit & Acceptance of Service; Town counsel Ahearn appears (docket). | Court jurisdiction perfected. | Parties now bound to schedules. | Cost meter starts for both sides. |
| **20 Apr 2022** | **Answer** filed (docket). | Joins issue; preserves defenses incl. local by‑law authority. | Town still stands on environmental findings. | Minimal spend; litigation could escalate. |
| **14 Aug 2022** | Judge’s **Status‑review order**: file update by 9 Sep or case dismissed. | Court pushes progress per Mass. R. Civ. P. 78. | No environmental content. | Pressure both sides—settle or brief. |
| **08 Sep 2022** | Joint status: *“agreement in principle; anticipate Commission public vote; need 60 days.”* (docket) | Settlement path announced; clock reset. | Deal‑making goes private. | Saves discovery / expert costs. |
| **09 Sep 2022** | Court continues to 9 Nov with dismissal warning. | Keeps pressure. | — | Cheap time extension; encourages deal finalisation. |
| **26 Oct 2022** | **Settlement Agreement/MOU** signed (not on docket but provided earlier). Key terms: Commission adopts MassDEP **SOC #338‑0706** as its WPA decision; Delapa files new NOI for dam repair (cost cap $25 000). | Resolves lawsuit contingently. | Town concedes WPA issue; retains by‑law say on dam work. | Compromise: avoids trial expense; house path clears, dam separated. |
| **20 Dec 2022** | Joint report: *“Settlement nearly complete; need 30 days.”* (docket) | Paperwork phase. | — | Delay cheaper than motion briefs. |
| **27 Mar 2023** | Second status‑review order—respond by 28 Apr. | Judge impatient. | — | Forces final filings. |
| **24 Apr 2023** | Plaintiff letter: *“Case settled; need 60 days for stipulation.”* — Court enters **Dismissal Nisi** expiring 26 Jun. | Automatic dismissal unless stip filed. | — | Hard deadline; ensures compliance with MOU conditions (e.g., filing dam NOI). |
| **22 Jun 2023** | **Joint Stipulation of Dismissal with prejudice; each side bears own fees.** (docket) | Case permanently closed; no cost‑shifting. | Integrity now dependent on permitting follow‑through. | Legal spend ends; parties avoid unpredictable judgment. |
| **23 Jun 2023** | Docket disposition: *“Disposed by Agreement / Settled.”* | Litigation leverage ends. | Environmental enforcement shifts back to Commission & DEP. | Settlement efficiency prevails over courtroom adjudication. |

## Influence balance (derived from filings)

| Influence | Evidence & effect | Who prevailed |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| **Procedural law** | Complaint centers on withdrawal right, FORAD supremacy, by‑law equivalence. Judge’s status orders push settlement. | **Delapa** gained leverage; Commission ceded WPA fight. |
| **Environmental integrity** | Commission’s denial cites large resource impacts; plaintiff never refutes numbers—argues process. Settlement splits dam vs. house, leaving real wetland alteration to later NOI. | **Mixed:** Town retains by‑law review for dam; house proceeds under SOC. |
| **Money & time** | No motions, discovery, or trial. Multiple continuances, quick dismissal. Each side pays own fees. | **Both saved costs**, but Delapa secures project path; town avoids fee liability. |
| **State authority vs. local autonomy** | DEP FORAD (2016) & SOC (2022) underpin plaintiff’s case; settlement forces Commission to adopt SOC. | **State standards trump local** for house/crossing; local retains dam oversight (for now). |

**Overall:** Legal‐procedural leverage and cost‑containment prevailed. The Commission’s environmental concerns were sidelined in court and partially parked in a future NOI, reflecting a strategy where **process wins over substance** when litigation risk and expense loom.

## Condensed Essence of the Litigation (added for quick reference)

**Core dispute** – Delapa’s single‑family‑home NOI was denied by the Commission under both the Wetlands Protection Act (WPA) and Westwood’s wetlands by‑law. She claims the Commission ignored a 2016 DEP Final ORAD, refused her withdrawal request, and applied no standards beyond WPA.

**Legal strategy** – The 31‑page complaint focuses on procedural error: certiorari to overturn the denial and declaratory counts to nullify the by‑law’s reach. This moved leverage from local regulators to Superior Court with modest filing costs.

**Commission stance** – The written denial cites 26 638 sf of wetland impacts, designates the on‑site stream perennial, and flags driveway/buffer violations—an integrity position grounded in broader wetland boundaries.

**Settlement mechanics** – Faced with repeated status‑review warnings (Aug 2022–Mar 2023) and rising litigation costs, the parties struck a deal on 26 Oct 2022: Commission adopts DEP Superseding OOC #338‑0706 (house & crossing approved); Delapa files a new NOI for dam work capped at $25 000.

**Outcome** – Joint dismissal with prejudice on 22 Jun 2023; each side bears its own fees. Procedural leverage and cost containment prevail: Delapa secures access & house, Commission retains dam oversight under its by‑law.

**Influence balance**
- *Process & state authority* overrode local environmental rigor.
- *Money/time efficiency* drove settlement pre‑motion.
- *Environmental integrity questions* (large impacts, perennial‑stream dispute) remain untested until dam‑repair NOI review.
